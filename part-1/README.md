# Part 1: Cookies and Ovens

### Release 0: Oven

We'll start by focusing on the tests describing our oven (see
`spec/oven-spec.js`).  To run the tests, navigate to the `part-1`
directory and execute:


```
$ open SpecRunner.html
```

This should launch a browser which will execute all of the Jasmine tests.  At
the outset, all tests fail.  Write code in the file `oven.js` so that all
of the tests for the oven pass.

## Conclusion

Once all the tests have passed, you have completed Part 1 of the assessment. If
you haven't done so already, commit your changes and move on to Part 2.
